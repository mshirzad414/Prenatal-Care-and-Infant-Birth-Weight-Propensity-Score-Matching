# Prenatal-Care-and-Infant-Brith-Weight-Propensity-Score-Matching
Evaluates the impact of prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy on subsequent birth weight in grams, with matching on several other determinants of weight

###This project measure the impact  of prenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy on subsequent birth weight in grams. This project focuses on understanding the relationship between early prenatal care and infant birth weight, leveraging propensity score matching techniques in R. The analysis is based on data extracted from the renowned study by Cattaneo (2010) published in the Journal of Econometrics (Volume 155, pages 138-154), which encompasses 4,642 observations across 23 variables related to factors influencing infant birth weight. However, our study specifically considers eight key variables that play a crucial role in determining birth weight outcomes. The varaible desciption is listed below. 
### Variables Description
bweight	Baby birthweight in grams 
mbsmoke	1, if mother smoked
mmarried	1, if mother is married
mage	Mother age
fbaby	1, if first baby
medu	Mother education attainment
alcohol	1, if alcohol consumed during pregnancy
